# Command-And-Conquer-Text-Game
Text Game based on the EA game Command and Conquer 3.  First version. This replicates sandbox mode. Most of the features are done. 
To do list:
1.Change the build unit method to only ask for amount if the unit meets all the requirements
2.Possibly add a special attribute to certain air units. This will help in limiting how many air units can be build per air field
3.Allow the player to go back in the menus
4.Allow the MCV to be either unpacked or stay mobile.
5.Allow the player to buy upgrades
6.Allow for units and buildings to receive their upgrades
